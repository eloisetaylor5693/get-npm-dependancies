# Get NPM Dependencies

When you search <https://www.npmjs.com/> for a package, it just gives the main dependancies, not the dependencies of the dependencies.  This is what I aim to do here.

Developed using node v14 and npm v6.14.  Tested on Firefox, and Brave browsers.     

## How to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run serve`
3. Load this page in a browser: `~\src\ui\index.html`
